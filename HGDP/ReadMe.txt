The HGDP Illumina 650K SNP data set was originally reported by Li et al. (2008).
We processed this data set so that it can be used as a reference panel for the LASER software in analyzing sequencing data.
The data processing procedure was described in the supplementary materials of the LASER paper (Wang et al., 2014).
